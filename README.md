# Experimentation with Kafka

Most of the code is generated by prompting Chat-GPT (3.5)

The app will connect to Kafka and poll all available topics and save the messages to an in-memory database. 

The app exposes endpoints to allow users to send and view messages.

1. Run `./scripts/sh` to start the Kafka broker in a Docker container
2. Run the app to start an HTTP server listening to `localhost:8000`


Endpoints:

1. GET `/topics/{topicName}/messages` to view messages
2. GET `/topics` to view topics
3. GET  `/broker/config` to view broker settings
4. POST `/topics/{topicName}/send` to send message to topic
```shell
curl -X POST \
   -d 'MessageContents' \
   http://localhost:8000/topics/topicName/send
```
